When a robot gets a new job right after finishing one, it can cause some problems. One big issue is when robots all want to use the same tools at the same time, which can cause everything to stop. Also, it might not be fair because some robots might get to do more tasks than others if they keep getting the tools first.

One way to fix these problems is to set up a system that decides which robot should do what job next. This system would look at how hard the job is or what the robot is best at doing. By doing this, we can make sure tools are used in the best way and stop robots from getting in each other's way. Also, if robots can tell each other when they're done with a job or when tools are free, they can work together better. This can make things more fair and help everything run more smoothly.
