For instance, there might be scenarios where four aircraft request landing simultaneously, leading to challenges in thread synchronization. Additionally, the processing power of the computer plays a critical role; the speed at which computations are executed, often measured in nanoseconds, can impact the efficiency of handling tasks. Should certain actions take longer than expected, the traffic pattern could become congested, potentially delaying emergency clearances for aircraft. To mitigate these challenges, it is crucial to implement concurrent programming with precision, ensuring threads are synchronized appropriately. Furthermore, enhancing the computer's processing power can contribute to more efficient and timely task execution.
